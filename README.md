# Digital-Filtering
This report briefly describes an exploration of digital filters in the time and frequency
domains. We start by exploring the behaviour of an M-point moving average. The moving average behaves like a low-pass filter and delays the components of an input by a constant factor of (M-1)/2 samples. Then we compared the behaviour of a finite impulse response filter and infinite impulse response filter, by looking at their magnitude, phase response and group delay. We found that the group delay for the FIR system is constant whereas there is a ripple in the group delay for an IIR filter. We also concluded that the IIR is less computationally complex than the FIR. Finally, we looked at the behaviour of two allpass filters in parallel and saw that instead of attenuating the components of a signal, it delays them. This is one application of allpass filters - equalizing the group delay of another filter to become constant in the passband.
