% Compare these results with those found for the FIR system described in 2.2. What are the differences? 
% For instance, how do the cut-off frequencies compare? 

% What is different about the group delay? 
% How does the computational complexity of this filter compare to that of the FIR?
% The group delay for the FIR system is fixed for all frequencies
